# Event Management Platform
`Event Booking G-20` website is basically for entertainment purpose, In this webapp, a user can book events tickets by choosing the different theatres and timings accordingly. The user also can see some events happening around them and can attend the events. It is hosted at https://g20eventbooking.netlify.app 

## Motivation
As demands of an automatic system in the management sector are high, we need to develop a unique web app for Event Management System. 
We have focused on creating an integrated platform that can assimilate event admins and users under a single roof. This would bring in ease for users to view & book tickets for any type of events in the platform - which is currently uncommon. 
## Description
Event Management Platform is a react website for operations on any general event. The website is built for two types of people: The Organizers and The Users.
The Organizers create and manage events. They can set the details about the event, the ticket prices, the seats, and the list of people attending the event. They can edit details, or delete their events as well.
The Users can view different events, and book tickets for them with some add on such as Food & Beverages. They can choose seats and give a rating to that event. The final calculated rating is used to recommend certain events to users.
A person can contact the website administrators through the contact us page, and they can provide feedback about the website through the Rate Us button. User can view all the events by clicking on Event on the top nav bar, there they can also filter the events according to Language, Genre.
After clicking, Proceed button, the user can make the payment and will be redirected to the home page. At the end, user can see their booking details in the booking history from the profile.
